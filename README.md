# Emissions Modeling Framework

The Emissions Modeling Framework (EMF) is a client-server system designed to store information related to emissions modeling, with integrated quality control processes. The EMF can drive and track emissions modeling processes, providing organization for model run settings, input datasets, and generated outputs. The Control Strategy Tool (CoST) is a component of the EMF used for estimating the emission reductions and economic costs associated with different control scenarios.
