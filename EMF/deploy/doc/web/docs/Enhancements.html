  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<strong>Deployment 20Jul2015 (v2.9):</strong>
<ul>
<li>EMF
  <ul>
  <li>This release adds a new feature that will allow a user to Archive or Restore a dataset or QA Step result. The archive process will still keep around the meta data on the dataset or QA Step, but the underlying data will be archived and removed from the database. The Restore process will allow the user to bring back the underlying data for the dataset or QA Step.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>CoST
  <ul>
  <li>The Control Measure Manager search box will now match control measures by name or abbreviation.</li>

  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<strong>Deployment 24Jun2015 (v2.8.2):</strong>

<li>CoST
  <ul>
  <li>Fixed the source matching hierarchy used by the Project Future Year Inventory strategy. This change affects records where a state code is formatted as 5 digits (i.e. 36000 rather than 36). Matching records with an exact county specified are now given priority over the state-level record.</li>
  <li>Added a new control strategy option to only apply control measures whose major pollutant matches the strategy's target pollutant. This option is on by default for newly created strategies.</li>
  <li>Fixed a spurious error message when checking if an inventory has sources matching the strategy's target pollutant</li>

  </ul>
</li>
<li>CoST

  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<strong>Deployment 16January2015:</strong>
<ul>
<li>CoST
  <ul>
  <li>When running Least Cost control strategies with multiple FF10 inventories, the inventories will now be merged into a unified FF10-based dataset. This avoids problems using inventory filters due to column name differences between FF10 and ORL inventories.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Bug fixes
  <ul>
  <li>Fixed broken data value filter search option in the Advanced Dataset Search.</li>

<li>EMF
  <ul>
  <li>Fixed contextual menu pop-up in the File Downloads window for Mac OS X users.</li>

  </ul>
</li>
<li>CoST
  <ul>
  <li>Simplified target pollutant selection when setting up control strategies. The target pollutant is now matched to the inventory sources using a wildcard search of pollutant names.</li>

  <li>Added option to enter notes about projects when editing control strategies.</li>
  <li>Added interface for creating control strategy groups. This allows grouping of related control strategies with a custom name and notes about each group.</li>

</li>
</ul>

<strong>Client Update 29September2014:</strong>

  </li>
</ul>

<strong>Deployment 17June2014 (EMF/CoST):</strong>
<ul>
  <li><em>Bug fixes:</em>
    <ul>
      <li>When exporting a dataset from the Dataset Manager, certain types of row filters would cause records from older versions of the dataset to be included in the exported file. This behavior is now fixed and the exported file will only contain records for the correct dataset version.</li>
      <li>When creating a controlled inventory after running a control strategy, the resulting datasets wouldn't use a user-specified prefix correctly. The controlled inventories will now be named with the custom prefix prepended to the original dataset name. Also, the custom prefix can start with a digit without causing any issues.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Enhancements:</em>
    <ul>
      <li>When exporting control measures, measures marked as Obsolete or Temporary will now be excluded by default. A new checkbox in the export dialog will allow you to include obsolete and temporary measures if desired.</li>
      <li>Ongoing work is being done to keep the interface more responsive when the client application needs to communicate with the server or handle longer tasks.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<strong>Deployment 08May2014 (EMF/CoST):</strong>
<ul>

<ul>
        <li>Fixed bug where the PM pollutant �primary� suffix (i.e., PM10-PRI was changed to PM10) is stripped off the pollutant code when importing Control, Projection, and Allowable datasets.  These pollutant codes are now allowed in inventories, and should be allowed to be controlled when running the Project Future Year Control Strategy Process.</li>
        <li>Fixed build issue where some EMF Client installations (using Java 6) were having issues due to software being built in Java 7.</li>
</ul>
