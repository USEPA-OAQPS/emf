## Background on the CoST Client-Server System

Because CoST is fully integrated within the EMF, installing CoST is the same as installing the EMF. There are two parts of the CoST/EMF system: a client and a server. In this guide, it is assumed that you need to install both the client and the server.

In the CoST client-server system, client software that runs on a desktop computer is used to connect to a server running the CoST algorithms and database. The CoST/EMF client is a Java program that accesses Java and [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org) software running on the CoST/EMF server. CoST/EMF requires that a recent version of Java be installed on each user's computer. The EMF database server stores information related to emissions modeling, including emissions inventory datasets and a database of emissions control measures. When a control strategy is developed, new datasets and summaries of them are created within CoST, and controlled emissions inventories can optionally be generated. These emissions inventories can be exported from CoST and then used as inputs to the SMOKE modeling system, which prepares emissions data for use in the CMAQ model. A schematic of the CoST/EMF client-server system see Figure {@fig:cost_emf_client_server}.

## Download the Software Installation Package

The software installation package is a ZIP file (~300MB) that contains all the relevant supporting applications and software required to run the CoST system on a Windows-based machine. The installation package also contains the most recent version of the CMDB available at the time of the software release. Instructions for optionally updating the CMDB are provided at the end of this section.

The CoST server requires [Java Runtime Environment 7 or 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html) (also known as JRE 1.7 or 1.8), [Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/index.html) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org).  All of these components are in the CoST/EMF installation package.

The total space required for the software is 5GB. Around 1.2GB of space can be freed at the end of the installation process. Make sure you have enough storage space (~40-50 GB) available to allow for future usage with your own custom inventories and control measures in the CoST system.

The CoST/EMF software package can be downloaded via the [Community Modeling and Analysis System (CMAS)](http://www.cmascenter.org).

A\. Download the CoST Windows Installation zip file from the CMAS software download site: [http://www.cmascenter.org/download/software.cfm](http://www.cmascenter.org/download/software.cfm)

B\. Unzip the downloaded file into a known folder location on a Windows machine.

Figure {@fig:installation_package} lists the batch file and the folders that are located in the install zip file; these are described below the figure.

<a id=Cost2></a>

## Installing CoST

Go to the root installation directory where the CoST/EMF zip file was installed and find the Install_EMF.bat executable file. Edit the bat file and change the following variables to match your computer's settings:

```
SET EMF_CLIENT_DIRECTORY=C:\Users\Public\EMF
SET EMF_DATA_DIRECTORY=C:\Users\Public\EMF_Data
SET POSTGRESDIR=C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.3
SET TOMCAT_DIR=C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 7.0
```

* `EMF_CLIENT_DIRECTORY` sets the location where the EMF client application will be installed. This is the location where you will find the CoST executable.
* `EMF_DATA_DIRECTORY` sets the location where the EMF data files (e.g., inventories and control measure import files) will be installed.
* `POSTGRESDIR` sets the location where the PostgreSQL application is installed.
* `TOMCAT_DIR` sets the location where the Tomcat application is installed.

Save, exit and double-click the file `Install_EMF.bat` to start the CoST/EMF server installation.

*Note: This installation process can take around 30-40 minutes to finish.* During the installation process, you will be prompted once (see Figure below) to enter the PostgreSQL superuser password, e.g., `postgres`.

<a id=cost_installation></a>

![CoST Installation](images/CoST_Installation.png){#fig:cost_installation}

After the server installer completes, go to the directory containing the EMF client application; this was specified in the Install_EMF.bat file via the `EMF_CLIENT_DIRECTORY` variable. Edit the EMFClient.bat batch file to match your computer's settings:

```
set EMF_HOME=C:\Users\Public\EMF
set JAVA_EXE=C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0\_51\bin\java
```

* `EMF_HOME` sets the location of EMF client application (set to be the same as `EMF_CLIENT_DIRECTORY` from the server installer above)
* `JAVA_EXE` sets the location of Java runtime application (note that the directory is C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0\_51\bin and java is the Java runtime application)

Save and exit from the file `EMFClient.bat`.

## Running CoST and Logging into the EMF Server

The CoST application can now be run by going to the EMF client directory and locating the `EMFClient.bat` file. Double click this file, and you will then be prompted to log in to the system. If the configuration was specified properly and the server is running, you should the following window.

<a id=login_emf></a>

![Login to the Emissions Modeling Framework Window](images/Login_to_the_Emissions_Modeling_Framework_Window.png){#fig:login_emf}

If you have never used the EMF before, click the `**`Register New User`**` button. You will then see the following window:

<a id=register_new_user></a>

![Register New User Window](images/Register_New_User_Window.png){#fig:register_new_user}

In the `Register New User` window, fill in your full name, affiliation, phone number, and email address. You may then select a username with at least three characters and enter a password with at least 8 characters and at least one digit and then click `OK`. Once your account has been created, the EMF main window should appear (see below).

If have logged into the EMF previously, enter your EMF username and password in the `Login to the Emissions Modeling Framework` window and click `Log In`. The following EMF main window will appear on your screen

*Note: The administrator EMF login name is `admin`, with a password `admin12345`*.

After successfully logging into CoST the main EMF window shown below will display.

<a id=emf_main_window></a>

![EMF Main Window](images/EMF_Main_Window.png){#fig:emf_main_window}

<a id=Upgrade2></a>

## (Optional) Upgrade the Control Measures Database (CMDB)

The CMDB includes all of the emissions control technology information, emissions reductions, and associated costs used by the EPA for developing emissions control strategies for stationary sources. The latest CMDB is available from the [EPA CoST Website](https://www.epa.gov/economic-and-cost-analysis-air-pollution-regulations/cost-analysis-modelstools-air-pollution).

The CoST/EMF installation package includes the latest version of the CMDB. The instructions here are provided to guide the upgrade of an existing EMF installation with a new version of the CMDB.

To install the CMDB in the EMF, first download the latest CMDB CSV file from the EPA website.  You must login to the EMF Client as Administrator to add to the CMDB to the CoST PostgreSQL database. After logging in as administrator select `Control Measures` from the `Manage` drop down menu at the top of the EMF Client window:

<a id=manage_control_measures></a>

![EMF Manage Control Measures](images/Manage_ControlMeasures.png){#fig:manage_control_measures}

Click the `Import` button to see the Import Control Measures screen:

<a id=import_control_measures></a>

![EMF Import Control Measures](images/ImportControlMeasures.png){#fig:import_control_measures}

Use the `Browse` button to find the CMDB CSV file downloaded from the EPA website. Select the file and click `OK`.

Click `Import` to add the EPA CMDB to the CoST/EMF database.

<a id=Remove2></a>

## (Optional) Removing CoST Installation Package

To remove the CoST installation package, go to the root directory where the EMF/CoST Installer zip file was installed and manually remove all files and sub folders from this directory. The original zip package contains a compressed version of the installation package and can be kept for reference purposes. Removing these files and directories will free up around 1.2GB of space.
