#REV_HISTORY v1(05/15/2017)  EMF Administrator.   CONTROL_MEASURES field for SCC 10100401  Add existing measure SCWSHUBCF
#REV_HISTORY v1(05/25/2017)  Zac.   Changed PM2_5 to PM25-PRI for Eqns 14 and 15  For proper application of controls
#REV_HISTORY v1(08/03/2017)  Zac.   Changed EQ 17 to PM15-PRI  Needed to match with control measure
