# Inventory Projection using the EMF #

## Introduction ##

The inventory projection process involves taking a base year inventory and projecting it to a future year inventory based on expected future activity levels and emissions controls. Within the [Emissions Modeling Framework][EMF User's Guide] (EMF), inventory projection is accomplished using the "Project Future Year Inventory" (PFYI) strategy in the [Control Strategy Tool][CoST User's Guide] (CoST) module. The Project Future Year Inventory control strategy matches a set of user-defined Control Programs to selected emissions inventories to estimate the emissions reductions in the target future year specified by the user. The output of the PFYI strategy can be used to generate a future year emissions inventory.

Control programs are used to describe the expected changes to the base year inventory in the future. The data includes plant closure information, control measures and their associated emissions impacts, growth or reduction factors to account for changes in activity levels, and other adjustments to emissions such as caps or replacements.

The CoST module is primarily used to estimate emissions reductions and costs incurred by applying different sets of control measures to emissions sources in a given year. CoST allows users to choose from several different algorithms (Control Strategies) for matching control measures to emission sources. Control strategies include "Maximum Emissions Reduction" (what is the maximum emissions reduction possible regardless of cost?) and "Least Cost" (what combination of control measures achieves a targeted emissions reduction at the least cost?).

Inventory projection has some underlying similarities to the "what if" control scenario processing available in CoST. For example, projecting an inventory requires a similar inventory source matching process and applying various factors to base emissions. However, there are some important differences between the two types of processing:

"What if" control strategies|Inventory projection
-|-
Estimates emissions reductions and costs for the same year as the input inventory|Estimates emissions changes for the selected future year
More concerned with cost estimates incurred by applying different control measures|Minimal support for cost estimates; primary focus is emissions changes
Matches sources with control measures from the Control Measure Database (CMDB)|Matches sources to data contained in user-created Control Programs

This document will detail the "Project Future Year Inventory" control strategy available in CoST. More information on general use of EMF and CoST is available at:

[Figure](#projection_workflow) shows the various datasets and processing steps used for inventory projection within the EMF.

![Data workflow for inventory projection][projection_workflow]

[projection_workflow]: images/projection_workflow.png

One or more base year inventories are imported into the EMF as inventory datasets. Files containing the control program data such as plant closures, growth or reduction factors (projection data), controls, and caps and replacements (allowable data) are also imported as datasets.

For each growth or control dataset, the user creates a Control Program. A Control Program specifies the type of program (i.e. plant closures, control measures to apply, growth or reduction factors) and the start and end date of the program. The dataset associated with the program identifies the inventory sources affected by the program and the factors to apply (e.g. the control efficiency of the associated control measure or the expected emissions reduction in the future year).

To create a Project Future Year Inventory control strategy, the user selects the input base year inventories and control programs to consider. The primary output of the control strategy is a Strategy Detailed Result dataset for each input inventory. The Strategy Detailed Result dataset consists of pairings of emission sources and control programs, each of which contains information about the emission adjustment that would be achieved if the control program were to be applied to the source.

The Strategy Detailed Result dataset can optionally be combined with the input inventory to create a future year inventory dataset. This future year inventory dataset can be exported to an inventory data file. The future year inventory dataset can also be used as input for additional control strategies to generate controlled future year emissions.

<!--- ### Cost Estimates ###

Along with estimating the emissions reductions for the future year, CoST will also estimate the costs associated with the controls applied. When applying control factors, CoST will search the Control Measure Database for the control measure that most closely matches the raw control packet data. If a probable measure is found for a source, the cost equations or cost-per-ton factor associated with the control measure will be used to estimate the cost of applying the control. -->

## Control Programs ##

### Introduction ###

The Project Future Year Inventory strategy uses various types of Control Programs to specify the expected changes to emissions between the base year and the future year. Each Control Program has a start date indicating when the control program takes effect, an optional end date, and an associated dataset which contains the program-specific factors to apply and source-matching information. There are four major types of control programs: Plant Closure, Projection, Control, and Allowable.

#### Plant Closure ####

A Plant Closure Control Program identifies specific plants to close. Each record in the plant closure dataset consists of:

* Some combination of source matching information
    * Region code (country/state/county)
    * Point source characteristics (facility ID, unit ID, release point ID, etc.)
* The effective date for the plant to close

Using the source matching options, you can specify particular stacks to close or close whole plants.

#### Projection ####

A Projection Control Program is used to apply growth or reduction factors to inventory emissions. Each record in the projection dataset consists of:

* Some combination of source matching information
    * Region code (country/state/county)
    * SCC
    * Point source characteristics (facility ID, unit ID, release point ID, etc.)
    * SIC, MACT, and/or NAICS
* An optional pollutant name for pollutant-specific projection factors
* The projection factor specified as a fraction. For example, a value of 1.2 means that emissions will increase 20%. Annual or monthly projection factors can be used.

#### Control ####

A Control-type Control Program is used to apply replacement or add-on control measures to inventory emissions. Each record in the control dataset consists of:

* Some combination of source matching information
    * Region code (country/state/county)
    * SCC
    * Point source characteristics (facility ID, unit ID, release point ID, etc.)
    * SIC, MACT, and/or NAICS
* An optional pollutant name for pollutant-specific controls
* The control measure abbreviation for matching to the CMDB
* A flag to indicate if the control is a replacement vs. an add-on control
* The control efficiency, rule effectiveness, and rule penetration values OR a combined percent reduction value. Annual or monthly reduction factors can be used.
* The compliance date indicating when the control can be applied to sources

#### Allowable ####

An Allowable Control Program is used to apply caps on inventory emissions or replacements to inventory emissions. Allowable Control Programs are applied after the other types of programs so that the impacts of the other programs can be accounted for when checking for emissions over the specified cap. Each record in the allowable dataset consists of:

* Some combination of source matching information
    * Region code (country/state/county)
    * SCC
    * Point source characteristics (facility ID, unit ID, release point ID, etc.)
    * SIC, MACT, and/or NAICS
* The pollutant name; this is optional but in most cases, the cap or replacement will be pollutant-specific
* The allowable emissions cap value OR replacement value; either value is specified in tons/day
* The compliance date indicating when the cap or replacement can be applied to sources

### Control Program Datasets ###

Each Control Program is associated with a dataset. [Table](#control_program_type_table) lists the EMF dataset types corresponding to each Control Program type. The Control Program datasets were designed to be compatible with the [SMOKE GCNTL (growth and controls) input file][smoke_gcntl] which uses the term "packet" to refer to the different types of control program data; the same term is used in the EMF.

[smoke_gcntl]: http://www.cmascenter.org/smoke/documentation/3.5.1/html/ch08s06.html target="_blank"

Control Program Type|Dataset Types
-|-
Allowable|Allowable Packet, Allowable Packet Extended
Control|Control Packet, Control Packet Extended
Plant Closure|Plant Closure Packet (CSV)
Projection|Projection Packet, Projection Packet Extended
[Control Program Types and Datasets][control_program_type_table]

The dataset formats named with "Extended" add additional options beyond the SMOKE-based formats. These extended formats use the same source information fields as Flat File 2010 inventories and also support monthly factors in addition to annual values. [Table](#ext_format_mapping_table) shows how the column names map between the extended and non-extended dataset formats.

Extended Format Column Name|Non-Extended Format Column Name|Description
-|-|-
REGION\_CD|FIPS|State/county code, or state code
FACILITY\_ID|PLANTID|Plant ID for point sources
UNIT\_ID|POINTID|Point ID for point sources
REL\_POINT\_ID|STACKID|Stack ID for point sources
PROCESS\_ID|SEGMENT|Segment for point sources
MACT|REG\_CD|Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) code
[Extended Format Mapping][ext_format_mapping_table]

The file formats for each control program dataset are listed in [Appendix A: Control Program Dataset Formats](#appendix_a).

#### Source Matching Hierarchy ####

When building Control Program dataset records, you can use various combinations of source matching information depending on the level of specificity needed. For example, you could create a projection factor that applies to all sources with a particular SCC in the inventory regardless of geographic location. In this case, the SCC code would be specified but the region code would be left blank. If you need a different factor for particular regions, you can add additional records that specify both the SCC and region code with the more specific factor.

When matching the Control Program dataset records to inventory sources, more specific matches will be used over less specific ones. In the case of ties, a defined hierarchy is used to rank the matches. This hierarchy is listed in [Appendix B: Control Program Source Matching Hierarchy](#appendix_b).

### Control Program Manager ###

The main interface for creating and editing Control Programs is the Control Program Manager. To open the Control Program Manager, select **Control Programs** from the main **Manage** menu at the top of the EMF window. A list of existing control programs is displayed as shown in [Figure](#cp_manager).

[cp_new_complete]: images/cp_new_complete.png

Once a dataset has been selected for a control program, the **View Data** and **View** buttons to the right of the dataset name will open the Data Viewer or Dataset Properties View for the selected dataset.

#### Control Measures and Technologies ####

The Measures and Technologies tabs in the Edit Control Program window are only used when working with Control-type Control Programs.

When a Control-type control program is used in a Project Future Year Inventory control strategy, CoST will try to match each applied control packet record to a control measure in the Control Measure Database in order to estimate associated costs. You can specify a list of probable control measures or control technologies when you define the control program to limit the potential matches.

In the Edit Control Program window, the Measures tab ([Figure](#cp_measures_tab)) lets you specify the control measures to include.

![Control measures associated with a control program][cp_measures_tab]

[cp_measures_tab]: images/cp_measures_tab.png

Click the **Add** button to open the Select Control Measures window. As shown in [Figure](#cp_select_measures), the Select Control Measures window lists all the defined control measures including the control measure's name, abbreviation, and major pollutant.

![Select Control Measures for Control Program][cp_select_measures]

[cp_select_measures]: images/cp_select_measures.png

You can use the filtering and sorting options to find the control measures of interest. Select the control measures you want to add then click the **OK** button to add the control measures to the Control Program and return to the Edit Control Program window.

To remove control measures, select the appropriate control measures, then click the **Remove** button.

The Technologies tab in the Edit Control Program window ([Figure](#cp_technologies_tab)) allows you to specify particular control technologies associated with the control program.

![Control technologies associated with a control program][cp_technologies_tab]

[cp_technologies_tab]: images/cp_technologies_tab.png

Click the **Add** button to open the Select Control Technologies window. As shown in [Figure](#cp_select_technologies), the Select Control Technologies window lists all the defined control technologies by name and description.

![Select Control Technologies for Control Program][cp_select_technologies]

[cp_select_technologies]: images/cp_select_technologies.png

You can use the filtering and sorting options to find the control technologies of interest. Select the control technologies you want to add then click the **OK** button to add the control technologies to the Control Program and return to the Edit Control Program window.

To remove control technologies, select the appropriate control technologies, then click the **Remove** button.

## Creating a Project Future Year Inventory Control Strategy ##

To create a Project Future Year Inventory Control Strategy, first open the Control Strategy Manager by selecting **Control Strategies** from the main **Manage** menu. [Figure](#cs_manager) shows the Control Strategy Manager window.

![Control Strategy Manager][cs_manager]

[cs_manager]: images/cs_manager.png

Click the **New** button to start creating the control strategy. You will first be prompted to enter a unique name for the control strategy as shown in [Figure](#cs_new_name).

![New control strategy name][cs_new_name]

[cs_new_name]: images/cs_new_name.png

Almost all of the strategy parameters for the Project Future Year Inventory strategy have the same meaning and act in the same way as they do for the Maximum Emissions Reduction strategy, such as cost year, inventory filter, and county dataset. This section focuses on parameters or inputs that differ for the Project Future Year Inventory strategy type.

### Summary Information ###

The Summary tab displays high-level parameters about the control strategy 
([Figure](#pfyi_summary_tab)).

![Project Future Year Inventory Summary tab][pfyi_summary_tab]

[pfyi_summary_tab]: images/pfyi_summary_tab.png

Parameters of interest for the Project Future Year Inventory strategy:

* **Type of Analysis**: Project Future Year Inventory

* **Target Year**: The target year represents the future year to which you are projecting the inventory. The target year is used when building the various cutoff dates (control compliance and plant closure effective dates) to evaluate whether or not certain control programs are applied to an inventory.

* **Target Pollutant**: The target pollutant is not used for the Project Future Year Inventory control strategy.

### Inventories ###

The Project Future Year Inventory strategy can use inventories in the following dataset types: Flat File 2010 Point, Flat File 2010 Nonpoint, ORL point, ORL nonpoint, ORL nonroad, or ORL nonroad. Multiple inventories can be processed in a single strategy. Note that multiple versions of the inventories may be available, and the appropriate version of each inventory must be selected prior to running a control strategy.

### Control Programs ###

The Programs tab in the Edit Control Strategy window is used to select which control programs should be considered in the strategy. [Figure](#pfyi_programs_tab) shows the Programs tab for an existing control strategy.

![Project Future Year Inventory Programs tab][pfyi_programs_tab]

[pfyi_programs_tab]: images/pfyi_programs_tab.png

Click the **Add** button to bring up the Select Control Programs window as shown in [Figure](#pfyi_select_programs).

![Select Control Programs for PFYI strategy][pfyi_select_programs]

[pfyi_select_programs]: images/pfyi_select_programs.png

In the Select Control Programs window, you can select which control programs to use in your PFYI control strategy. The table displays the name, control program type, and description for all defined control programs. You can use the filter and sorting options to help find the control programs you are interested in. Select the checkbox next to each control program to add and then click the **OK** button to return to the Programs tab.

To remove control programs from the strategy, select the programs to remove and then click the **Remove** button. The **Edit** button will open an Edit Control Program window for each of the selected control programs.

More than one of the same type of control program can be added to a strategy. For example, you could add three Plant Closure Control Programs: Cement Plant Closures, Power Plant Closures, and Boiler Closures. All three of these control programs would be evaluated and a record of the evaluation would be stored in the Strategy Detailed Result. If there happen to be multiple Projection, Control, or Allowable Type Control Programs added to a strategy, packets of the same type are merged into one packet during the matching analysis so that no duplicate source-control-packet pairings are created. Duplicate records will be identified during the run process and the user will be prompted to remove duplicates before the core algorithm performs the projection process.

### Constraints ###

[Figure](#pfyi_constraints_tab) shows the Constraints tab for a Project Future Year Inventory strategy. The only constraint used by PFYI strategies is a strategy-specific constraint named Minimum Percent Reduction Difference for Predicting Controls (%). This constraint determines whether a predicted control measure has a similar percent reduction to the percent reduction specified in the Control Program Control Packet.

![Project Future Year Inventory Constraints tab][pfyi_constraints_tab]

[pfyi_constraints_tab]: images/pfyi_constraints_tab.png

## Running the Control Strategy ##

To run the Project Future Year Inventory control strategy, click the **Run** button at the bottom of the Edit Control Strategy window. The EMF will begin running the strategy. Check the Status window to monitor the status of the run.

### Control Program Application Order ###

The Project Future Year Inventory strategy processes Control Programs in the following order:

1. Plant Closure control programs
2. Projection control programs
3. Control type control programs
4. Allowable control programs

The Control analysis is dependent on the Projection analysis; likewise, the Allowable analysis is dependent on the Projection and Control analyses. The adjusted source emission values need to be carried along from each analysis step to make sure each portion of the analysis applies the correct adjustment factor. For example, a source could be projected, and also controlled, in addition to having a cap placed on the source. Or, a source could have a projection or control requirement, or perhaps just a cap or replacement requirement.

## Outputs from the Control Strategy ##

### Strategy Detailed Result ###

The main output for each control strategy is a table called the Strategy Detailed Result. This dataset consists of pairings of emission sources and control programs, each of which contains information about the emission adjustment that would be achieved if the control program were to be applied to the source, along with the cost of application. The Strategy Detailed Result table can be used with the original input inventory to produce, in an automated manner, a controlled emissions inventory that reflects implementation of the strategy; this inventory includes information about the control programs that have been applied to the controlled sources. The controlled inventory can then be directly input to the SMOKE modeling system to prepare air quality model-ready emissions data. In addition, comments are placed at the top of the inventory file to indicate the strategy that produced it and the settings of the high-level parameters that were used to run the strategy.

The columns in the Strategy Detailed Result dataset are described in [Appendix C: Control Strategy Output Dataset Formats](#appendix_c), [Table](#strategy_detailed_result_columns_table).

### Strategy Messages ###

In additional to the Strategy Detailed Result dataset, CoST automatically generates a Strategy Messages dataset. The Strategy Messages output provides useful information that is gathered while the strategy is running. This output can store ERROR and WARNING types of messages. If an ERROR is encountered during the prerun validation process, the strategy run will be canceled and the user can peruse this dataset to see what problems the strategy has (e.g., duplicate packet records).

The columns in the Strategy Messages dataset are described in [Appendix C: Control Strategy Output Dataset Formats](#appendix_c), [Table](#strategy_messages_columns_table).

## Creating Future Year Inventories ##

After the Project Future Year Inventory control strategy has been run, you can create a future year emissions inventory. From the Outputs tab, select the Strategy Detailed Result for the base year inventory and select the **Controlled Inventory** radio button as shown in [Figure](#cs_create_inv).

![Creating a future year inventory][cs_create_inv]

[cs_create_inv]: images/cs_create_inv.png

Click the **Create** button to begin creating the future year inventory. Monitor the Status window for messages and to see when the process is complete.

The future year inventory will automatically be added as a dataset matching the dataset type of the base year inventory. The new dataset's description will contain comments indicating the strategy used to produce it and the high-level settings for that strategy.

*For ORL Inventories:*

For the sources that were controlled, CoST fills in the CEFF (control efficiency), REFF (rule effectiveness), and RPEN (rule penetration) columns based on the Control Packets applied to the sources. The CEFF column is populated differently for a replacement Control Packet record than for an add-on Control Packet record. For a replacement control, the CEFF column is populated with the percent reduction of the replacement control. For an add-on control, the CEFF column is populated with the overall combined percent reduction of the add-on control plus the preexisting control, using the following formula:

(1 – {[1 – (existing percent reduction / 100)] x [1 – (add-on percent reduction / 100)]}) x 100

For both types of Control Packet records (add-on or replacement), the REFF and RPEN are defaulted to 100 since the CEFF accounts for any variation in the REFF and RPEN by using the percent reduction instead of solely the CEFF.

Note that only Control Packets (not Plant Closure, Projection, or Allowable packets) will be used to help populate the columns discussed above.

*For Flat File 2010 Inventories:*

For the sources that were controlled, CoST fills in the annual (ANN\_PCT\_RED) and monthly percent reduction (JAN\_PCT\_RED) columns based on the values for the Control Packet that was applied to the sources. The CEFF column is populated differently for a replacement control than for an add-on control. For a replacement control, the CEFF column is populated with the percent reduction of the replacement control. For an add-on control, the CEFF column is populated with the overall combined percent reduction of the add-on control plus the preexisting control, using the following formula:

(1 – {[1 – (existing percent reduction / 100)] x [1 – (add-on percent reduction / 100)]}) x 100

For both types of measures, the REFF and RPEN values are defaulted to 100, because the CEFF accounts for any variation in the REFF or RPEN by using the percent reduction instead of the CEFF.

CoST also populates several additional columns toward the end of the ORL and Flat File 2010 inventory rows that specify information about measures that it has applied. These columns are:

* CONTROL MEASURES: An ampersand (&amp;) separated list of control measure abbreviations that correspond to the control measures that have been applied to the given source.

* PCT REDUCTION: An ampersand-separated list of percent reductions that have been applied to the source, where percent reduction = CEFF x REFF x RPEN.

* CURRENT COST: The annualized cost for that source for the most recent control strategy that was applied to the source.

* TOTAL COST: The total cost for the source across all measures that have been applied to the source.

## Appendix A: Control Program Dataset Formats [appendix_a] ##

### Plant Closure Packet ###

The format of the Plant Closure Packet described in [Table](#plant_closure_format_table) is based on the CSV format. The first row of this dataset file must contain the column header definition as defined in Line 1 of [Table](#plant_closure_format_table). All the columns specified here must be included in the dataset import file.

Line|Position|Description
-|-|-
1|A..H|Column header definition - must contain the following columns: fips,plantid,pointid,stackid,segment,plant,effective\_date,reference

[Plant Closure Packet Data Format][plant_closure_format_table]

### Projection Packet ###

The format of the Projection Packet ([Table](#projection_format_table)) is based on the SMOKE file format as defined in the [SMOKE User's Manual][PROJ]. One modification was made to enhance this packet's use in CoST: the unused SMOKE column at position K is now used to store the NAICS code.

[Projection Packet Data Format][projection_format_table]

### Projection Packet Extended ###

The format of the Projection Packet Extended ([Table](#projection_ext_format_table)) dataset is not based on the SMOKE format. It is based on the EMF Flexible File Format, which is based on the CSV-based format. This new format uses column names that are aligned with the Flat File 2010 dataset types in the EMF system. The format also supports monthly projection factors in addition to annual projection factors. For example, instead of using the FIPS code, the new format uses the REGION\_CD column, and instead of PLANTID the new format uses FACILITY\_ID. The appropriate mapping between the old and new formats is described in [Table](#ext_format_mapping_table). The new format also contains additional columns that will be used in the future to help further enhance the inventory source matching capabilities, these include COUNTRY\_CD, TRIBAL\_CODE, CENSUS\_TRACT\_CD, SHAPE\_ID, and EMIS\_TYPE.

Column|Description
-|-
Country\_cd|Country code, optional; currently not used in matching process
Region\_cd|State/county code, or state code with blank for county, or zero (or blank or -9) for all state/county or state codes
Facility\_id|Facility ID (aka Plant ID in ORL format) for point sources, optional; blank, zero, or -9 if not specified; leave blank for nonpoint inventories
Unit\_id|Unit ID (aka Point ID for ORL format) for point sources, optional; blank, zero,￼or -9 if not specified; leave blank for nonpoint inventories
Rel\_point\_id|Release Point ID (aka Stack ID in ORL format) for point sources, optional; blank, zero, or -9 if not specified; leave blank for nonpoint inventories

### Control Packet ###

The format of the Control Packet ([Table](#control_format_table)) is based on the SMOKE file format as defined in the [SMOKE User's Manual][CONTROL]. Several modifications were made to enhance the packet's use in CoST:

1. The unused SMOKE column at position D is now used to store the primary control measure abbreviation; if one is specified, this measure is used on any source that was matched with those control packet entries.
2. The unused SMOKE column at position P is used to store the compliance date the control can be applied to sources.
3. The unused SMOKE column at position Q is used to store the NAICS code.

### Control Packet Extended ###

The format of the Control Packet Extended ([Table](#control_ext_format_table)) dataset is not based on the SMOKE format. It is based on the EMF Flexible File Format, which is based on the CSV-based format. This new format uses column names that are aligned with the Flat File 2010 dataset types in the EMF system. The format also contains additional columns that will be used in the future to help further enhance the inventory source matching capabilities: COUNTRY\_CD, TRIBAL\_CODE, CENSUS\_TRACT\_CD, SHAPE\_ID, and EMIS\_TYPE.

### Effective and Compliance Date Handling [effective_date_section] ###

For control programs that use an effective date (plant closures) or compliance date (controls), CoST uses the control strategy target year to build a cutoff date to use when determining which programs are in effect. To specify the month and day of the cutoff date (used in combination with the target year), there are two EMF system-level properties. These properties are stored in the emf.properties table and are named `COST_PROJECT_FUTURE_YEAR_EFFECTIVE_DATE_CUTOFF_MONTHDAY` (for effective dates) and `COST_PROJECT_FUTURE_YEAR_COMPLIANCE_DATE_CUTOFF_MONTHDAY` (for compliance dates). To set a cutoff month/day of October 1, the property value would be "10/01".

For a strategy with a target year of 2020 and an effective cutoff month/day of 10/01, the closure effective cutoff date is 10/01/2020.

Closure Record Effective Date|Outcome
-|-
07/01/2013|Effective date is before the cutoff date so all sources matching this record will be closed
blank|All sources matching this record will be closed
11/15/2020|Effective date is after the cutoff date so matching sources will not be closed

## Appendix B: Control Program Source Matching Hierarchy [appendix_b] ##

[Table](#control_packet_hierarchy_table) lists the source matching  combinations, the inventory types the matching criteria can be used for, and the Control Program Packet Types that can use these criteria.
